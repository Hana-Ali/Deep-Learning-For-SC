This is main a *brainstorming text file*, of what the steps needed to go from fMRI to dMRI are and how to do This

DATA INPUTS:
------------
-> For each patient, we have dMRI and fMRI data associated with them
-> Futher, we also have the --- STRUCTURAL: fODs, tracts, SC matrices --- FUNCTIONAL: FC matrices --- 
-> We can use many different atlases and parcellation schemes, where each one has different information that can be
   exploited (READ INTO IF THIS MAKES A DIFFERENCE - BELIEVE I'VE READ IT DOES)


DESIRES:
-------
-> We should take into consideration the distribution of each modality (IN BASIRA LAB PAPERS), as well as the
distribution of graph factors such as centrality, etc
-> We should take into consideration the topological properties of the SC and FC matrices
-> We should IDEALLY incorporate the actual dMRI and fMRI into it somehow
    (What of the dMRI can we look at?

OUTPUT: 
------
Given the fMRI of an individual, it should output what the SC matrix or dMRI should look like

VALIDATION:
----------
Given an FC matrix, it should output what the SC matrix is, then we can validate how well it performs in a WBM or just
compare it to the real SC
